# Twokinds rating Analysis July 1st 2025

Well apparently imgur is a bad place to store this type of stuff at least if 
i intend them to reference in the future as imgur seems to automatically delete
posts that are hidden or are not very popular

Oh well i guess i will have to use Microsoft disks space instead keeping all in
GitHub will make it oh so much easier to deal with this than keeping everything
in 7 different places.

So with that out of the way. Let me welcome you again to this year edition of
    the Twokinds Rating Analysis ðŸŽ‰

I had been caught in other stuff so had not been able to get a more up to date
    version. Does not help that my last post got removed by imgur so it is now
    kinda lost.

Anyhow as usual these graphs show a comparison of the number of Tom safe and
suggestive art pieces and how each has evolved through time. Again results are grouped in 3 month intervals. 

Rating was obtained from e621 which even if the rating criteria is a bit too lax
for my taste. As it does not classify nude breast as explicit. For Tom art it is
enough in my opinion.

Important note for this time due to the way i group data the very last tip of the graphs may be a bit off since we are just at the end of a Quarter

## All arts
First these graphs show all pieces by Tom colored or otherwise since 2015-09-01. 
It shows a moderate increase in suggestive pieces but we are still well away from
the early days of Patreon before the polls

## Color Arts
This is the same as before but shows only colored art he has made. We see an importan increase in suggestive colored art from late 2024 to today
